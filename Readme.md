# Let's Go 🚀- My Golang Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Golang Learning Journey** repository! 🎉

This repository serves as a personal log of my progress as I learn and experiment with the **Go programming language**. Starting from the basics, I’ll document my growth by writing code, solving problems, and building small projects along the way.

## About This Repository 📚

The goal of this repository is to:
- **Track my progress** in learning Golang. 📈
- **Share code snippets** and solutions to exercises. 💻
- **Document key concepts** I’ve learned along the way. 📝
- **Build a reference point** for myself and others who are on a similar learning journey. 🌍

## Repository Structure 🗂️

The repository is organized into various folders based on the topics or projects I’m working on. Here’s a rough breakdown:

- `001-Hello_World/` - The very first program to cool the nerves and see <b>GO</b> in action for the first time. 🤖

As I continue learning, I will add more sections and projects to this repository. 🚧
